# Flexhire Backend

This repository contains the backend application for the Flexhire Code Test.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   
   git clone https://github.com/coderroy05/flexhireteam-backend.git
   cd flexhireteam-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update it with your configuration.

   
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration options.

4. **Run the Backend:**

   
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Testing Webhooks Locally:**

   For testing webhooks locally, you can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Start ngrok with:

   
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

   Ngrok will provide you with a public URL that can be used as a webhook endpoint.

6. **Endpoints:**

   - Your API endpoints and their functionalities go here.

7. **Deployment (Optional):**

   For deployment options, consider using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other preferred hosting service.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have API access activated for your Flexhire account.
- Review the Flexhire API documentation for details on making API requests.
